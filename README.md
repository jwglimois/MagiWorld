# Project Title: MagiWorld

MagiWorld is a French game with 3 characters: Warrior (Guerrier), Thief (RÃ´deur), and Magician (Mage). 
We run the game by choosing 2 players in the beginning. Each player has a role of one of the characters above.

Each character has specific capacities defined by a combination of 5 features:
* Life = Level * 5
* Level = Strength + Agility + Intelligence
* Strength 
* Agility
* Intelligence
 
Each character owns 2 kinds of attacks: 

* Warrior: 
    - While he launches a basic attack (Sword Strike):  His enemy will get damage equal to his strength. 
    - While he launches a special attack (Anger Strike): His enemy will get damage equal to twice of his strength. 
                                                       			The player will, as for him, lose vitality equal to half of his strength.
* Thief: 
    - While he launches a basic attack (Archery):  His enemy will get damage equal to his agility. 
    - While he launches a special attack (Concentration):  The player will gain ability equal to twice of his level.

* Magician: 
    - While he launches a basic attack (Fireball):  His enemy will get damage equal to his intelligence. 
    - While he launches a special attack (Care):  The player will gain vitality equal to twice of his intelligence. The new vitality should not be greater than the old one.
